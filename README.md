this is a transposition cipher breaker. it uses brute force to test all possible keys, and then compares how much of the resulting file is english words rather than gibberish. last, it returns the highest-performing key and corresponding file. 

this also includes a test file. just run it, it will randomly generate a key to encrypt the provided sample file.
